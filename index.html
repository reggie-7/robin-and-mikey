    <h1>Manga vs Anime</h1> 
    <hr>
    <h2>Reading manga is better than watching anime</h2>
    <P> Manga is superior to anime because it provides a deeper connection to the story and characters, allowing readers to engage at their own pace and appreciate the intricate details of the artwork. Unlike anime, which often rushes or skips content due to time constraints, manga remains faithful to the creatorâ€™s original vision. Additionally, manga is more accessible and portable, making it easier to enjoy anywhere. While anime offers animation and sound, it can sometimes dilute the storytelling with filler or inconsistent quality. Ultimately, manga offers a purer, more personal experience that anime cannot replicate.</P>
